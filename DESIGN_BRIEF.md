# Duckie v2 Design Direction

> A focused design brief for the website redesign.

---

## The Problem

The current site looks like every other dark SaaS template:
- Blur orbs, frosted glass, gradient text — overused everywhere
- Repetitive section patterns (dot → subtitle → headline)
- No memorable moments or distinctive personality
- Basic fade-in animations that don't stand out
- Duck/pond theme isn't leveraged, just decoration

**Goal**: Create something that feels polished, modern, and unmistakably "Duckie" — without gimmicks.

## Design Direction

### Precision Craft + Motion Identity

Stand out through **exceptional execution** and **distinctive motion**, not through themes or gimmicks.

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Craft** | Perfect spacing, sharp typography, obsessive details |
| **Motion** | Snappy, precise interactions on everything |
| **Product** | UI woven throughout — show, don't just tell |
| **Restraint** | Duck/pond as subtle accents only (logo, easter eggs) |

**Visitors should feel**: Impressed by the quality, excited by the product.

## The Vibe

Think of the best-in-class tools you actually enjoy using — Linear, Notion, Stripe, Vercel. They don't try to be flashy or clever. They just feel *right*. Every click responds instantly. Every transition is smooth. The typography is confident. The spacing breathes. You trust them because the craft signals competence.

That's what we're going for. A site that feels like it was built by people who care deeply about details. Light and airy, but not sterile. Professional, but not corporate. The kind of site where you notice something new every time you visit — a subtle animation, a perfect alignment, a thoughtful interaction. The duck theme is there if you look for it, but it's not trying to be cute. It's confident.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Theme** | Light with dark accents | Stands out (everyone's dark now), shows craft better, more approachable |
| **Motion** | Snappy & precise | Fast response, smooth settle, nothing sluggish |
| **Product UI** | Woven throughout | SVG product images as core visuals, not decoration |
| **Duck theme** | Subtle only | Logo animation, occasional accent — not the design language |

## Dark/Light Balance

~80% light, ~20% dark. Dark components create rhythm and emphasis:
